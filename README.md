# Using-CNN-for-Image-classification-
In this Repository I used Convolution neural network for Image Classification 


This Is A basic repository used to show How can we Use to classify image.
We use basic Ciraf dataset to train our neural network.
 
## Basic requirements ##
* install keras 
* install tensorflow 
* install jupyter notebook 
* install numpy 

## Steps ##
* first open jupyter notebook
* second follow the code 
* You can call my generated api as declared "Cifar_simple_cnn_2.h5"
* Or used to train your model and do save the particular model in same directory so as to make it callable
